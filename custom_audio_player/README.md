# TS Custom Audio Player

This code was inspired by the following blog post:
https://gomakethings.com/a-simple-progressively-enhanced-audio-player-with-vanilla-js/

The code is largely the same, but has some additional accessibility added such as keeping the native player around but hiding it visually. Here's more info for how to apply hidden yet accessible content: https://accessibility.18f.gov/hidden-content/

The JS was written in Vanilla code and can pose issues if AJAX is involved. Ideally, a jQuery solution will be added to this directory too.
